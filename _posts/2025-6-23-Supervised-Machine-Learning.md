When training is done on a Laballed data-set, with known input and output, those algorithms learns to map between input and correct output.

## What is Machine Lerning
In simple terms, Machine Learning is a branch of Artifical Intelligence, that makes the machine think and understand like humans by learning from data.

## Types of machine learning
We can generally distinguish here between 4 types.

1. Supervised Machine Learning.
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning.
3. Semi-supervised Machine Learning.
4. Reinforcement Learning.

## Supervised Machine Learning:
let's now get right into the topic of our discussion, the ***Supervised Machine Learning***, which is basically when training is done on a **Labelled** data-set, with known input and output, those alogorithms learn basically how to map or connect between the input and the correct output.

### Categories:
Within the **Supervised Machine Learning** we can differenciate between two categories:

- Classification
- Regression

#### Classification:
is basically a way of telling whether a thing is the thing or not, for example classifying whether someone is blind or not, or is the email a spam or not.

***Alogirthms***:
- Logistic Regression
- Support vector machine
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes

#### Regression:
Deals with predicting Continuous numerical values, like predicting the price of a house based on its size.

- Linear regression
- Polynomial regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision tree
- Random forest.

### Advantages of supervised machine learning:
- High accuracy: cause labelled datasets.
- interpretable
- It can often be used in pre-trained models which saves time and resources when developing new models from scratch.
